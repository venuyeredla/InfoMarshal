#### Graph terminology and notes.

Graph =(V,E)  Where V={v0,v1..  vn} Where E={e0,e1..  en}

Loop : Edge between a Vertex itself. 

Trail : A sequence of distinct edges e1e2 · · · ek is called a trail if we can take a continuous walk in our graph, first walking through the edge e1, then the edge e2, and so on. In other words, the endpoint of ei is the starting point of ei+1.

Walk:  is like a trail, except that all edges do not need to be distinct.

Closed trail : If, in addition, we start the drawing at the same vertex where we end it, then we say that e1e2 ···ek is a closed trail.



Eulerian trail : A trail using all edges of G.

Path : If a trail does not touch any vertex twice, then we call it a path.

Hamiltonian path: A path that includes all vertices of a graph is called

Cycle : A cycle in a graph is a closed trail that does not touch any vertex twice, except, of course the initial vertex, that must also be the ending vertex.

Hamiltonian cycle : A cycle that includes all vertices of a graph.

Circuit



Degree: No of edges connected a Vertex 


Infinite & Finite 

Simple : If a graph G has no loops, and has no multiple edges between the same pair of points

Multiple : If there are loop or multiple edges between any pair of nodes.

Connected & Unconnected Graphs :

Directed & Undirected : 

Regular Graph : The graph in which the degree of every vertex is equal to the other vertices of the graph. Let the degree of each vertex be K then the graph

Complete Graph :  

Representation : Adjacency List,  Adjacency Matix, Incident Matrix.

Spanning Tree : Let G be a simple graph. A spanning tree of G is a subgraph of G that is a tree containing every vertex of G.

Minimum Spanning Tree : A minimum spanning tree in a connected weighted graph is a spanning tree that has the smallest possible sum of weights of its edges.
